- Imports order
- Interfaces only where needed
- Case of naming (files, functions, class methods)
- Aliases
- Migrations script
- Spacing
- All packages that used only for developing should be in devDependencies (nodemon, types etc.)
- Type that being used in more than 2 places should be exported from types folder (example in types)
- Autoformating max-len eslint rule doesn't work, need to research how to fix it
- All imports must be from modules 
import DB from '../helpers/db' - not good
import { DB } from '@/helpers' - good
